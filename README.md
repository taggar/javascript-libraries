# Javascript Libraries

## Introduction

Often when you are working on a project, you might need to write something extensive which isn't even a part of the main goal for that project.
This can result in a large time loss, which isnt always acceptable, ... This is where learning how to work with javascript libraries / plugins can be a real help.
So for this exercise we're going to look into some JS Plugins / Libraries and learn how we can quickly / efficiently read them and start working with them.

## Learning objectives

### What and why
* What are some libraries?
* How do we get started quickly with them
* How do I look for them?

### How

* Fancybox / Lightbox
* ParticlesJS
* wow JS
* ...

## Instructions

### Setup
* Create a couple of pages: ["fancybox", "particles", "wow", "..."]
* On each of the pages, show off the functionality of the given library
* The "..." is a library you need to choose & look up
* Write in your readme which library you chose and why
* Commit now, and often ðŸ˜‰

### Fancybox / Lightbox
* Create clickable images through which you can scroll in an overlay
* Lightbox has multiple versions (incl fancybox), choose one that fits your needs (this is personal)
* Make sure this page has a photo gallery on which we can click and browse through the images

### Particles
* ParticlesJS has a website on which it has a demo page as a standard, so you see what it does
* Now make it work on your particles page, use the documentation to understand the plugin

### WOW JS
* WOW JS gets a lot of crap for it's site but is a widely recognized respected plugin, go over the demo page to see what it does, but use the documentation to learn how it works
* Make sure you have some rows (not in a table) with a left and right column, switch sides between text and image every row
* Now animate those elements in on scroll

### ....
* Now find a different library, one we didn't use yet (also not in the same category of any of the above)
* Show off it's functionality and work in becode content somewhere in that plugin (images / text / icons / ... )
